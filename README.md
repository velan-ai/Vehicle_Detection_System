## Overview
The **Vehicle Detection System** is an AI-powered solution designed to detect and classify vehicles in images and video streams. This project leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify vehicles in various environments, making it suitable for applications such as traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and security surveillance.

## Features
- **Real-time vehicle detection** using deep learning models.
- **Pre-trained models** for high accuracy and efficiency.
- **Custom dataset training support** for domain-specific applications.
- **Bounding box visualization** for detected vehicles.
- **Scalability and integration** into existing traffic surveillance systems.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/velan-ai/Vehicle_Detection_System.git
   cd Vehicle_Detection_System
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download pre-trained models (if applicable) and place them in the appropriate directory.

## Usage
Run the detection script on an image:
```sh
python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
Run the detection script on a video:
```sh
python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4
```
For real-time webcam detection:
```sh
python detect.py --webcam
```

## Dataset
This project supports various public vehicle detection datasets. You can also train on your custom dataset by following the data preparation instructions in `data/README.md`.

## Model Architecture
The detection model is based on state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as:
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
- **Faster R-CNN**
- **SSD (Single Shot Detector)**

## Results
Here are sample detection results from our trained model:
